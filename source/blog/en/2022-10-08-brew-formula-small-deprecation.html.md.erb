I was upgrading the go version of my [personal project][1] the other day.
READ_MORE

I moved from `go 1.16` to `go 1.19`. I had to come out with a new version. I
upgraded my custom brew package as I always do; fix the `url` and `sha` fields
in the Formula, fix the basic test under `test` area.

I pushed my changes and started to wait github actions’ checks. Checks are
failed, due to brew’s formula style guide:

    ==> brew style vigo/statoo
    ==> FAILED
    Full style vigo/statoo output
      Formula/statoo.rb:18:5: C: Use generate_completions_from_executable DSL instead of (bash_completion/"statoo").write #{bin}/statoo bash-completion.
          (bash_completion/"statoo").write `#{bin}/statoo bash-completion`
          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    
      2 files inspected, 1 offense detected
      Error: Use `generate_completions_from_executable` DSL instead of `(bash_completion/"statoo").write `#{bin}/statoo bash-completion``.

In the `install` part of the formula; bash completion related setup was
written as shown below:

```ruby
def install
  system "go", "build", *std_go_args
  (bash_completion/"statoo").write `#{bin}/statoo bash-completion`
end
```

Checker was telling me that, I should use
`generate_completions_from_executable` DSL instead of old one. Well, what was
that? when was changed? Let’s fix this :) First, let’s [read the docs][2],
then change the code to:

```ruby
def install
  system "go", "build", *std_go_args
  generate_completions_from_executable(bin/"statoo", "bash-completion", "completions", shells: [:bash])
end
```

Break down of args:

- `bin/"statoo"` is the executable path
- `bash-completion` is an arg for `statoo` executable, generates bash related completion code.
- `completions` is the `base_name`
- Completion code is compatible with `bash` only, therefor I set the shel `:bash` only.

I spent an hour to fix and understand the problem and solution. I couldn’t
find any examples or documentation about this new formula style change... This
is why I’m writing this blog post so that will be useful to other brewers :)

Here is the function signature of `generate_completions_from_executable`:

```ruby
generate_completions_from_executable(
  *commands, 
  base_name: name, 
  shells: [:bash, :zsh, :fish], 
  shell_parameter_format: nil
) ⇒ void
```

I hope this post will help, happy brew packaging! You can check project and
